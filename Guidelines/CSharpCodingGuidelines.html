<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-this-">What is this?</h2>
<p>This document attempts to provide guidelines (or coding standards if you like) for coding in C# 3.0, 4.0 or 5.0 that are both useful and pragmatic. Of course, if you create such a document you should practice what you preach. So rest assured, these guidelines are representative to what we at <a href="http://www.avivasolutions.nl">Aviva Solutions</a> do in our day-to-day work. Notice that not all guidelines have a clear rationale. Some of them are simply choices we made at Aviva Solutions. In the end, it doesn&#39;t matter what choice you made, as long as you make one and apply it consistently.</p>
<p>Visual Studio&#39;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264939.aspx">Static Code Analysis</a> (which is also known as FxCop) and <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/">StyleCop</a> can already automatically enforce a lot of coding and design rules by analyzing the compiled assemblies. You can configure it to do that at compile time or as part of a continuous or daily build. The companion site <a href="http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com">www.csharpcodingguidelines.com</a> provides a list of code analysis rules depending on the type of code base you&#39;re dealing with. This document just provides an additional set of rules and recommendations that should help you achieve a more maintainable code base.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-you-use-this-document-">Why would you use this document?</h2>
<p>Although some might see coding guidelines as undesired overhead or something that limits creativity, this approach has already proven its value for many years. This is because not every developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>is aware that code is generally read 10 times more than it is changed;</li>
<li>is aware of the potential pitfalls of certain constructions in C#;</li>
<li>is up to speed on certain conventions when using the .NET Framework such as <code>IDisposable</code> or the deferred execution nature of LINQ;</li>
<li>is aware of the impact of using (or neglecting to use) particular solutions on aspects like security, performance, multi-language support, etc;</li>
<li>realizes that not every developer is as capable, skilled or experienced to understand elegant, but potentially very abstract solutions;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic principles</h2>
<p>There are many unexpected things I run into during my work as a consultant, each deserving at least one guideline. Unfortunately, I still need to keep this document within a reasonable size. But unlike what some junior developers believe, that doesn&#39;t mean that something is okay just because it is not mentioned in this document.</p>
<p>In general, if I have a discussion with a colleague about a smell that this document does not cover, I&#39;ll refer back to a set of basic principles that apply to all situations, regardless of context. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Principle of Least Surprise (or Astonishment): you should choose a solution that everyone can understand, and that keeps them on the right track.</li>
<li>Keep It Simple Stupid (a.k.a. KISS): the simplest solution is more than sufficient.</li>
<li>You Ain&#39;t Gonna Need It (a.k.a. YAGNI): create a solution for the problem at hand, not for the ones you think may happen later on. Can you predict the future?</li>
<li>Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself (a.k.a. DRY): avoid duplication within a component, a source control repository or  a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html">bounded context</a>, without forgetting the <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/10/31/abstraction-the-rule-of-three/">Rule of Three</a> heuristic.</li>
<li>In general, generated code should not need to comply with coding guidelines. However, if it is possible to modify the templates used for generation, try to make them generate code that complies as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the elegance of someone&#39;s solution, if it&#39;s too complex for the ordinary developer, exposes unusual behavior, or tries to solve many possible future issues, it is very likely the wrong solution and needs redesign. The worst response a developer can give you to these principles is: &quot;But it works?&quot;. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-get-started-">How do you get started?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask all developers to carefully read this document at least once. This will give them a sense of the kind of guidelines the document contains. </li>
<li>Make sure there are always a few hard copies of the <a href="http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com/">Quick Reference</a> close at hand. </li>
<li>Include the most critical coding guidelines on your <a href="http://www.continuousimprover.com/2010/03/alm-practices-5-checklists.html">Project Checklist</a> and verify the remainder as part of your <a href="http://www.dennisdoomen.net/2010/02/tfs-development-practices-part-2-peer.html">Peer Review</a>. </li>
<li>Consider forking the <a href="https://github.com/dennisdoomen/csharpguidelines">original sources</a> on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and create your own <a href="https://github.com/dennisdoomen/csharpguidelines/blob/master/LICENSE.md">internal</a> version of the document.</li>
<li>Decide which CA rules are applicable for your project and store these somewhere, such as your source control system, or create a custom Visual Studio Rule Set. The <a href="http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com/">companion site</a> offers rule sets for both line-of-business applications and more generic code bases, like frameworks and class libraries.</li>
<li>Add a custom <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb514188.aspx">Code Analysis Dictionary</a> containing your domain or company-specific terms, names and concepts. If you don&#39;t, Static Analysis will report warnings for (parts of) phrases that are not in its internal dictionary. </li>
<li>Configure Visual Studio to verify the selected CA rules as part of the Release build. Then they won&#39;t interfere with normal developing and debugging activities, but still can be run by switching to the Release configuration. </li>
<li>Add an item to your project checklist to make sure all new code is verified against CA violations, or use something like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182075(v=vs.110">Check-in Policy</a>.aspx) or a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">Git commit hook</a> to prevent any code from violating CA rules at all. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> has an intelligent code inspection engine that, with some configuration, already supports many aspects of the Coding Guidelines. It automatically highlights any code that does not match the rules for naming members (e.g. Pascal or Camel casing), detects dead code, and many other things. One click of the mouse button (or the corresponding keyboard shortcut) is usually enough to fix it. </li>
<li>ReSharper also has a File Structure window that displays an overview of the members of your class or interface, and allows you to easily rearrange them using a simple drag-and-drop action. </li>
<li>Using <a href="http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx">GhostDoc</a> you can generate XML comments for any member using a keyboard shortcut. The beauty of it is that it closely follows the MSDN-style of documentation. However, you have to be careful not to misuse this tool, and use it as a starter only. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-did-we-create-it-">Why did we create it?</h2>
<p>The idea started in 2002 when Vic Hartog (Philips Medical Systems) and I were assigned the task of writing up a <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/gemrcsharpcs.pdf">coding standard</a> for C# 1.0. Since then, I&#39;ve regularly added, removed and changed rules based on experiences, feedback from the community and new tooling support offered by a continuous stream of new Visual Studio releases.</p>
<p>Additionally, after reading <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Robert C. Martin</a>&#39;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a>, I became a big fan of his ideas and decided to include some of his smells and heuristics as guidelines. Notice though, that this document is in no way a replacement for his book. I sincerely recommend that you read his book to gain a solid understanding of the rationale behind his recommendations.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also decided to include some design guidelines in addition to simple coding guidelines. They are too important to ignore and have a big influence in reaching high quality code.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-coding-standard-">Is this a coding standard?</h2>
<p>The document does not state that projects must comply with these guidelines, neither does it say which guidelines are more important than others. However, we encourage projects to decide themselves which guidelines are important, what deviations a project will use, who is the consultant in case doubts arise, and what kind of layout must be used for source code. Obviously, you should make these decisions before starting the real coding work.</p>
<p>To help you in this decision, I&#39;ve assigned a level of importance to each guideline:</p>
<p><img src="images/1.png" alt=""> Guidelines that you should never skip and should be applicable to all situations</p>
<p><img src="images/2.png" alt=""> Strongly recommended guidelines</p>
<p><img src="images/3.png" alt=""> May not be applicable in all situations</p>

<h1 id="class-design-guidelines">Class Design Guidelines</h1>
<h3 id="a-class-or-interface-should-have-a-single-purpose-av1000-images-1-png-">A class or interface should have a single purpose (AV1000) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>A class or interface should have a single purpose within the system it functions in. In general, a class either represents a primitive type like an email or ISBN number, an abstraction of some business concept, a plain data structure, or is responsible for orchestrating the interaction between other classes. It is never a combination of those. This rule is widely known as the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf">Single Responsibility Principle</a>, one of the S.O.L.I.D. principles.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A class with the word <code>And</code> in it is an obvious violation of this rule.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science">Design Patterns</a>) to communicate the intent of a class. If you can&#39;t assign a single design pattern to a class, chances are that it is doing more than one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If you create a class representing a primitive type you can greatly simplify its use by making it immutable.</p>
<h3 id="only-create-a-constructor-that-returns-a-useful-object-av1001-images-3-png-">Only create a constructor that returns a useful object (AV1001) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>There should be no need to set additional properties before the object can be used for whatever purpose it was designed. However, if your constructor needs more than three parameters (which violates AV1561), your class might have too much responsibility (and violates AV1000).</p>
<h3 id="an-interface-should-be-small-and-focused-av1003-images-2-png-">An interface should be small and focused (AV1003) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Interfaces should have a name that clearly explains their purpose or role in the system. Do not combine many vaguely related members on the same interface just because they were all on the same class. Separate the members based on the responsibility of those members, so that callers only need to call or implement the interface related to a particular task. This rule is more commonly known as the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/isp.pdf">Interface Segregation Principle</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use-an-interface-rather-than-a-base-class-to-support-multiple-implementations-av1004-images-3-png-">Use an interface rather than a base class to support multiple implementations (AV1004) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If you want to expose an extension point from your class, expose it as an interface rather than as a base class. You don&#39;t want to force users of that extension point to derive their implementations from a base class that might have an undesired behavior. However, for their convenience you may implement a(n abstract) default implementation that can serve as a starting point.</p>
<h3 id="use-an-interface-to-decouple-classes-from-each-other-av1005-images-2-png-">Use an interface to decouple classes from each other (AV1005) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Interfaces are a very effective mechanism for decoupling classes from each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can prevent bidirectional associations; </li>
<li>They simplify the replacement of one implementation with another; </li>
<li>They allow the replacement of an expensive external service or resource with a temporary stub for use in a non-production environment.</li>
<li>They allow the replacement of the actual implementation with a dummy implementation or a fake object in a unit test; </li>
<li>Using a dependency injection framework you can centralize the choice of which class is used whenever a specific interface is requested.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid-static-classes-av1008-images-3-png-">Avoid static classes (AV1008) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>With the exception of extension method containers, static classes very often lead to badly designed code. They are also very difficult, if not impossible, to test in isolation, unless you&#39;re willing to use some very hacky tools.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you really need that static class, mark it as static so that the compiler can prevent instance members and instantiating your class. This relieves you of creating an explicit private constructor.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-hide-inherited-members-with-the-new-keyword-av1010-images-1-png-">Don&#39;t hide inherited members with the new keyword (AV1010) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Not only does the new keyword break <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming">Polymorphism</a>, one of the most essential object-orientation principles, it also makes sub-classes more difficult to understand. Consider the following two classes:</p>
<pre><code>public class Book  
{
    public virtual void Print()  
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Printing Book&quot;);
    }  
}

public class PocketBook : Book  
{
    public new void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Printing PocketBook&quot;);
    }  
}
</code></pre><p>This will cause behavior that you would not normally expect from class hierarchies:</p>
<pre><code>PocketBook pocketBook = new PocketBook();

pocketBook.Print(); // Outputs &quot;Printing PocketBook &quot;

((Book)pocketBook).Print(); // Outputs &quot;Printing Book&quot;
</code></pre><p>It should not make a difference whether you call <code>Print()</code> through a reference to the base class or through the derived class.</p>
<h3 id="it-should-be-possible-to-treat-a-derived-object-as-if-it-were-a-base-class-object-av1011-images-2-png-">It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it were a base class object (AV1011) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>In other words, you should be able to use a reference to an object of a derived class wherever a reference to its base class object is used without knowing the specific derived class. A very notorious example of a violation of this rule is throwing a <code>NotImplementedException</code> when overriding some of the base-class methods. A less subtle example is not honoring the behavior expected by the base class.   </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This rule is also known as the Liskov Substitution Principle, one of the <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx">S.O.L.I.D.</a> principles.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-refer-to-derived-classes-from-the-base-class-av1013-images-1-png-">Don&#39;t refer to derived classes from the base class (AV1013) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Having dependencies from a base class to its sub-classes goes against proper object-oriented design and might prevent other developers from adding new derived classes.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-exposing-the-other-objects-an-object-depends-on-av1014-images-2-png-">Avoid exposing the other objects an object depends on (AV1014) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If you find yourself writing code like this then you might be violating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a>.</p>
<pre><code>someObject.SomeProperty.GetChild().Foo()
</code></pre><p>An object should not expose any other classes it depends on because callers may misuse that exposed property or method to access the object behind it. By doing so, you allow calling code to become coupled to the class you are using, and thereby limiting the chance that you can easily replace it in a future stage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using a class that is designed using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">Fluent Interface</a> pattern seems to violate this rule, but it is simply returning itself so that method chaining is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Inversion of Control or Dependency Injection frameworks often require you to expose a dependency as a public property. As long as this property is not used for anything other than dependency injection I would not consider it a violation.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-bidirectional-dependencies-av1020-images-1-png-">Avoid bidirectional dependencies (AV1020) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>This means that two classes know about each other&#39;s public members or rely on each other&#39;s internal behavior. Refactoring or replacing one of those classes requires changes on both parties and may involve a lot of unexpected work. The most obvious way of breaking that dependency is to introduce an interface for one of the classes and using Dependency Injection.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Domain models such as defined in <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/">Domain-Driven Design</a> tend to occasionally involve bidirectional associations that model real-life associations. In those cases, make sure they are really necessary, and if they are, keep them in.</p>
<h3 id="classes-should-have-state-and-behavior-av1025-images-1-png-">Classes should have state and behavior (AV1025) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>In general, if you find a lot of data-only classes in your code base, you probably also have a few (static) classes with a lot of behavior (see AV1008). Use the principles of object-orientation explained in this section and move the logic close to the data it applies to.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> The only exceptions to this rule are classes that are used to transfer data over a communication channel, also called <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html">Data Transfer Objects</a>, or a class that wraps several parameters of a method.</p>
<h1 id="member-design-guidelines">Member Design Guidelines</h1>
<h3 id="allow-properties-to-be-set-in-any-order-av1100-images-1-png-">Allow properties to be set in any order (AV1100) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Properties should be stateless with respect to other properties, i.e. there should not be a difference between first setting property <code>DataSource</code> and then <code>DataMember</code> or vice-versa.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-method-instead-of-a-property-av1105-images-3-png-">Use a method instead of a property (AV1105) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<ul>
<li>If the work is more expensive than setting a field value. </li>
<li>If it represents a conversion such as the <code>Object.ToString</code> method.</li>
<li>If it returns a different result each time it is called, even if the arguments didn&#39;t change. For example, the <code>NewGuid</code> method returns a different value each time it is called.</li>
<li>If the operation causes a side effect such as changing some internal state not directly related to the property (which violates the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html">Command Query Separation</a> principle). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Populating an internal cache or implementing <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/lazyLoad.html">lazy-loading</a> is a good exception.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-use-mutual-exclusive-properties-av1110-images-1-png-">Don&#39;t use mutual exclusive properties (AV1110) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Having properties that cannot be used at the same time typically signals a type that represents two conflicting concepts. Even though those concepts may share some of their behavior and states, they obviously have different rules that do not cooperate.</p>
<p>This violation is often seen in domain models and introduces all kinds of conditional logic related to those conflicting rules, causing a ripple effect that significantly increases the maintenance burden.</p>
<h3 id="a-method-or-property-should-do-only-one-thing-av1115-images-1-png-">A method or property should do only one thing (AV1115) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Similarly to rule AV1000, a method should have a single responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-expose-stateful-objects-through-static-members-av1125-images-2-png-">Don&#39;t expose stateful objects through static members (AV1125) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>A stateful object is an object that contains many properties and lots of behavior behind it. If you expose such an object through a static property or method of some other object, it will be very difficult to refactor or unit test a class that relies on such a stateful object. In general, introducing a construction like that is a great example of violating many of the guidelines of this chapter.</p>
<p>A classic example of this is the <code>HttpContext.Current</code> property, part of ASP.NET. Many see the <code>HttpContext</code> class as a source of a lot of ugly code. In fact, the testing guideline <a href="http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2005/10/21/haacked-on-tdd-and-jeremys-first-rule-of-tdd/">Isolate the Ugly Stuff</a> often refers to this class.</p>
<h3 id="return-an-ienumerable-t-or-icollection-t-instead-of-a-concrete-collection-class-av1130-images-2-png-">Return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of a concrete collection class (AV1130) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>You generally don&#39;t want callers to be able to change an internal collection, so don&#39;t return arrays, lists or other collection classes directly. Instead, return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, or, if the caller must be able to determine the count, an <code>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you&#39;re using .NET 4.5, you can also use <code>IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="properties-methods-and-arguments-representing-strings-or-collections-should-never-be-null-av1135-images-1-png-">Properties, methods and arguments representing strings or collections should never be <code>null</code> (AV1135) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Returning <code>null</code> can be unexpected by the caller. Always return an empty collection or an empty string instead of a <code>null</code> reference. This also prevents cluttering your code base with additional checks for <code>null</code>, or even worse, <code>string.IsNullOrEmpty()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="define-parameters-as-specific-as-possible-av1137-images-2-png-">Define parameters as specific as possible (AV1137) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If your member needs a specific piece of data, define parameters as specific as that and don&#39;t take a container object instead. For instance, consider a method that needs a connection string that is exposed through a central <code>IConfiguration</code> interface. Rather than taking a dependency on the entire configuration, just define a parameter for the connection string. This not only prevents unnecessary coupling, it also improved maintainability in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An easy trick to remember this guideline is the <em>Don&#39;t ship the truck if you only need a package</em>.</p>
<h3 id="consider-using-domain-specific-value-types-rather-than-primitives-av1140-images-3-png-">Consider using domain-specific value types rather than primitives (AV1140) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Instead of using strings, integers and decimals for representing domain-specific types such as an ISBN number, an email address or amount of money, consider created dedicated value objects that wrap both the data and the validation rules that apply to it. By doing this, you prevent ending up having multiple implementations of the same business rules, which both improves maintainability and prevents bugs.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-design-guidelines">Miscellaneous Design Guidelines</h1>
<h3 id="throw-exceptions-rather-than-returning-some-kind-of-status-value-av1200-images-2-png-">Throw exceptions rather than returning some kind of status value (AV1200) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>A code base that uses return values to report success or failure tends to have nested if-statements sprinkled all over the code. Quite often, a caller forgets to check the return value anyway. Structured exception handling has been introduced to allow you to throw exceptions and catch or replace them at a higher layer. In most systems it is quite common to throw exceptions whenever an unexpected situation occurs.</p>
<h3 id="provide-a-rich-and-meaningful-exception-message-text-av1202-images-2-png-">Provide a rich and meaningful exception message text (AV1202) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>The message should explain the cause of the exception, and clearly describe what needs to be done to avoid the exception.</p>
<h3 id="throw-the-most-specific-exception-that-is-appropriate-av1205-images-3-png-">Throw the most specific exception that is appropriate (AV1205) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>For example, if a method receives a <code>null</code> argument, it should throw <code>ArgumentNullException</code> instead of its base type <code>ArgumentException</code>.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-swallow-errors-by-catching-generic-exceptions-av1210-images-1-png-">Don&#39;t swallow errors by catching generic exceptions  (AV1210) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Avoid swallowing errors by catching non-specific exceptions, such as <code>Exception</code>, <code>SystemException</code>, and so on, in application code. Only top-level code, such as a last-chance exception handler, should catch a non-specific exception for logging purposes and a graceful shutdown of the application.</p>
<h3 id="properly-handle-exceptions-in-asynchronous-code-av1215-images-2-png-">Properly handle exceptions in asynchronous code (AV1215) <img src="images/2.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>When throwing or handling exceptions in code that uses <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> or a <code>Task</code> remember the following two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceptions that occur within an <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> block and inside a <code>Task</code>&#39;s action are propagated to the awaiter.</li>
<li>Exceptions that occur in the code preceding the asynchronous block are propagated to the caller.</li>

<p>An event that has no subscribers is <code>null</code>, so before invoking, always make sure that the delegate list represented by the event variable is not <code>null</code>.

<p>Complying with this guideline allows derived classes to handle a base class event by overriding the protected method. The name of the protected virtual method should be the same as the event name prefixed with <code>On</code>. For example, the protected virtual method for an event named <code>TimeChanged</code> is named <code>OnTimeChanged</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Derived classes that override the protected virtual method are not required to call the base class implementation. The base class must continue to work correctly even if its implementation is not called.</p>
<h3 id="consider-providing-property-changed-events-av1230-images-3-png-">Consider providing property-changed events (AV1230) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Consider providing events that are raised when certain properties are changed. Such an event should be named <code>PropertyChanged</code>, where <code>Property</code> should be replaced with the name of the property with which this event is associated</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your class has many properties that require corresponding events, consider implementing the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interface instead. It is often used in the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">Presentation Model</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx">Model-View-ViewModel</a> patterns.</p>

<p>Often an event handler is used to handle similar events from multiple senders. The sender argument is then used to get to the source of the event. Always pass a reference to the source (typically <code>this</code>) when raising the event. Furthermore don&#39;t pass <code>null</code> as the event data parameter when raising an event. If there is no event data, pass <code>EventArgs.Empty</code> instead of <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of casting to and from the object type in generic types or methods, use <code>where</code> constraints or the <code>as</code> operator to specify the exact characteristics of the generic parameter. For example:</p>
<pre><code>class SomeClass  
{}

// Don&#39;t  
class MyClass  
{
    void SomeMethod(T t)  
    {  
        object temp = t;  
        SomeClass obj = (SomeClass) temp;  
    }

}
</code></pre><p>Since LINQ queries use deferred execution, returning <code>query</code> will actually return the expression tree representing the above query. Each time the caller evaluates this result using a <code>foreach</code> cycle or similar, the entire query is re-executed resulting in new instances of <code>GoldMember</code> every time. Consequently, you cannot use the <code>==</code> operator to compare multiple <code>GoldMember</code> instances. Instead, always explicitly evaluate the result of a LINQ query using <code>ToList()</code>, <code>ToArray()</code> or similar methods.</p>

Also notice that the parameters with the same name should appear in the same position in all overloads.</p>

<h3 id="only-use-optional-arguments-to-replace-overloads-av1553-images-1-png-">Only use optional arguments to replace overloads (AV1553) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>The only valid reason for using C# 4.0&#39;s optional arguments is to replace the example from rule AV1551 with a single method like:</p>
<pre><code>public virtual int IndexOf(string phrase, int startIndex = 0, int count = 0)
{
    return someText.IndexOf(phrase, startIndex, count);

</code></pre><p>If the optional parameter is a reference type then it can only have a default value of <code>null</code>. But since strings, lists and collections should never be <code>null</code> according to rule AV1235, you must use overloaded methods instead.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The default values of the optional parameters are stored at the caller side. As such, changing the default value without recompiling the calling code will not apply the new default value properly.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When an interface method defines an optional parameter, its default value is not considered during overload resolution unless you call the concrete class through the interface reference.

<p><strong>Exception:</strong> The only exception where named arguments improve readability is when calling a method of some code base you don&#39;t control that has a <code>bool</code> parameter, like this:  </p>

<p>If you create a method with more than three parameters, use a structure or class to pass multiple arguments, as explained in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern">Specification design pattern</a>.

<p>If you use <code>as</code> to obtain a certain interface reference from an object, always ensure that this operation does not return <code>null</code>. Failure to do so may cause a <code>NullReferenceException</code> at a much later stage if the object did not implement that interface.

<h3 id="use-us-english-av1701-images-1-png-">Use US-English (AV1701) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>All type members, parameters and variables should be named using words from the American English language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose easily readable, preferably grammatically correct names. For example, <code>HorizontalAlignment</code> is more readable than <code>AlignmentHorizontal</code>.</li>
<li>Favor readability over brevity. The property name <code>CanScrollHorizontally</code> is better than <code>ScrollableX</code> (an obscure reference to the X-axis).</li>
<li>Avoid using names that conflict with keywords of widely used programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> In most projects, you will use words and phrases from your domain and names specific to your company. Visual Studio&#39;s Static Code Analysis performs a spelling check on all code, so you may need to add those terms to a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fxcop/archive/2007/08/20/new-for-visual-studio-2008-custom-dictionaries.aspx">Custom Code Analysis Dictionary</a>.</p>

<p>Bad examples include <code>SearchExamination</code> (a page to search for examinations), <code>Common</code> (does not end with a noun, and does not explain its purpose) and <code>SiteSecurity</code> (although the name is technically okay, it does not say anything about its purpose). Good examples include <code>BusinessBinder</code>, <code>SmartTextBox</code>, or <code>EditableSingleCustomer</code>.</p>

<p>.NET developers are already accustomed to the naming patterns the framework uses, so following this same pattern helps them find their way in your classes as well. For instance, if you define a class that behaves like a collection, provide members like <code>Add</code>, <code>Remove</code> and <code>Count</code> instead of <code>AddItem</code>, <code>Delete</code> or <code>NumberOfItems</code>.</p>

<li>Consider prefixing boolean properties with <code>Is</code>, <code>Has</code>, <code>Can</code>, <code>Allows</code>, or <code>Supports</code>.</li>
<li>Consider giving a property the same name as its type. When you have a property that is strongly typed to an enumeration, the name of the property can be the same as the name of the enumeration. For example, if you have an enumeration named <code>CacheLevel</code>, a property that returns one of its values can also be named <code>CacheLevel</code>.</li>

<p>Name methods using a verb like <code>Show</code> or a verb-object pair such as <code>ShowDialog</code>. A good name should give a hint on the <em>what</em> of a member, and if possible, the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Also, don&#39;t include <code>And</code> in the name of a method. It implies that the method is doing more than one thing, which violates the single responsibility principle explained in AV1115.</p>
<h3 id="name-namespaces-using-names-layers-verbs-and-features-av1725-images-3-png-">Name namespaces using names, layers, verbs and features  (AV1725) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>For instance, the following namespaces are good examples of that guideline.</p>
<pre><code>AvivaSolutions.Commerce.Web
NHibernate.Extensibility
Microsoft.ServiceModel.WebApi
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugging
FluentAssertion.Primitives
CaliburnMicro.Extensions

<p>Name events with a verb or a verb phrase. For example: <code>Click</code>, <code>Deleted</code>, <code>Closing</code>, <code>Minimizing</code>, and <code>Arriving</code>. For example, the declaration of the <code>Search</code> event may look like this:</p>
<pre><code>public event EventHandler&lt;SearchArgs&gt; Search;
</code></pre><h3 id="use-ing-and-ed-to-express-pre-events-and-post-events-av1737-images-3-png-">Use <code>-ing</code> and <code>-ed</code> to express pre-events and post-events  (AV1737) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>For example, a close event that is raised before a window is closed would be called <code>Closing</code>, and one that is raised after the window is closed would be called <code>Closed</code>. Don&#39;t use <code>Before</code> or <code>After</code> prefixes or suffixes to indicate pre and post events.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to define events related to the deletion of an object. Avoid defining the <code>Deleting</code> and <code>Deleted</code> events as <code>BeginDelete</code> and <code>EndDelete</code>. Define those events as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Deleting</code>: Occurs just before the object is getting deleted</li>
<li><code>Delete</code>: Occurs when the object needs to be deleted by the event handler.</li>
<li><code>Deleted</code>: Occurs when the object is already deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prefix-an-event-handler-with-on-av1738-images-3-png-">Prefix an event handler with <code>On</code> (AV1738) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>It is good practice to prefix the method that handles an event with <code>On</code>. For example, a method that handles the <code>Closing</code> event can be named <code>OnClosing</code>.</p>
<h3 id="use-an-underscore-for-irrelevant-lambda-parameters-av1739-images-3-png-">Use an underscore for irrelevant lambda parameters (AV1739) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If you use a lambda statement, for instance, to subscribe to an event, and the actual parameters of the event are irrelevant, use the following convention to make that more explicit:</p>
<pre><code>button.Click += (\_, \_\_) =&gt; HandleClick();
</code></pre><h3 id="group-extension-methods-in-a-class-suffixed-with-extensions-av1745-images-3-png-">Group extension methods in a class suffixed with Extensions (AV1745) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If the name of an extension method conflicts with another member or extension method, you must prefix the call with the class name. Having them in a dedicated class with the <code>Extensions</code> suffix improves readability.</p>

<p>The general convention for methods that return <code>Task</code> or <code>Task&lt;TResult&gt;</code> is to post-fix them with <code>Async</code>, but if such a method already exists, use <code>TaskAsync</code> instead.</p>
<h1 id="performance-guidelines">Performance Guidelines</h1>
<h3 id="consider-using-any-to-determine-whether-an-ienumerable-t-is-empty-av1800-images-3-png-">Consider using <code>Any()</code> to determine whether an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> is empty (AV1800) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>When a method or other member returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> or other collection class that does not expose a <code>Count</code> property, use the <code>Any()</code> extension method rather than <code>Count()</code> to determine whether the collection contains items. If you do use <code>Count()</code>, you risk that iterating over the entire collection might have a significant impact (such as when it really is an <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> to a persistent store).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> to prevent editing from outside the owner as explained in AV1130, and you&#39;re developing in .NET 4.5 or higher, consider the new read-only classes.</p>
<h3 id="only-use-async-for-low-intensive-long-running-activities-av1820-images-1-png-">Only use <code>async</code> for low-intensive long-running activities (AV1820) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>The usage of <code>async</code> won&#39;t automagically run something on a worker thread like <code>Task.Run</code> does. It just adds the necessary logic to allow releasing the current thread, and marshal the result back on that same thread if a long-running asynchronous operation has completed. In other words, use <code>async</code> only for I/O bound operations.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-task-run-for-cpu-intensive-activities-av1825-images-1-png-">Prefer <code>Task.Run</code> for CPU-intensive activities (AV1825) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>If you do need to execute a CPU bound operation, use <code>Task.Run</code> to offload the work to a thread from the Thread Pool. Remember that you have to marshal the result back to your main thread manually.</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-mixing-up-await-async-with-task-wait-av1830-images-1-png-">Beware of mixing up <code>await</code>/<code>async</code> with <code>Task.Wait</code> (AV1830) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p><code>await</code> does not block the current thread but simply instructs the compiler to generate a state-machine. However, <code>Task.Wait</code> blocks the thread and may even cause deadlocks (see AV1835).</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-async-await-deadlocks-in-single-threaded-environments-av1835-images-1-png-">Beware of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> deadlocks in single-threaded environments (AV1835) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Consider the following asynchronous method:</p>
<pre><code>private async Task GetDataAsync()
{
    var result = await MyWebService.GetDataAsync();
    return result.ToString();
}
</code></pre><p>Now when an ASP.NET MVC controller action does this:</p>
<pre><code>public ActionResult ActionAsync()
{
    var data = GetDataAsync().Result;

    return View(data);  
}
</code></pre><p>You end up with a deadlock. Why? Because the <code>Result</code> property getter will block until the <code>async</code> operation has completed, but since an <code>async</code> method will automatically marshal the result back to the original thread and ASP.NET uses a single-threaded synchronization context, they&#39;ll be waiting on each other. A similar problem can also happen on WPF, Silverlight or a Windows Store C#/XAML app. Read more about this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/01/13/10115163.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="framework-guidelines">Framework Guidelines</h1>
<h3 id="use-c-type-aliases-instead-of-the-types-from-the-system-namespace-av2201-images-1-png-">Use C# type aliases instead of the types from the <code>System</code> namespace  (AV2201) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>For instance, use <code>object</code> instead of <code>Object</code>, <code>string</code> instead of <code>String</code>, and <code>int</code> instead of <code>Int32</code>. These aliases have been introduced to make the primitive types first class citizens of the C# language, so use them accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> When referring to static members of those types, it is custom to use the full CLS name, e.g. <code>Int32.Parse()</code> instead of <code>int.Parse()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="properly-name-properties-variables-or-fields-referring-to-localized-resources-av2205-images-3-png-">Properly name properties, variables or fields referring to localized resources  (AV2205) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>The guidelines in this topic apply to localizable resources such as error messages and menu text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Pascal casing in resource keys.</li>
<li>Provide descriptive identifiers rather than short ones. Keep them concise where possible, but don&#39;t sacrifice readability.</li>
<li>Use only alphanumeric characters in naming resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="don-t-hard-code-strings-that-change-based-on-the-deployment-av2207-images-3-png-">Don&#39;t hard-code strings that change based on the deployment  (AV2207) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Examples include connection strings, server addresses, etc. Use <code>Resources</code>, the <code>ConnectionStrings</code> property of the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> class, or the <code>Settings</code> class generated by Visual Studio. Maintain the actual values into the <code>app.config</code> or <code>web.config</code> (and most definitely not in a custom configuration store).</p>
<h3 id="build-with-the-highest-warning-level-av2210-images-1-png-">Build with the highest warning level  (AV2210) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Configure the development environment to use <strong>Warning Level 4</strong> for the C# compiler, and enable the option <strong>Treat warnings as errors</strong> . This allows the compiler to enforce the highest possible code quality.</p>
<h3 id="properly-fill-the-attributes-of-the-assemblyinfo-cs-file-av2215-images-3-png-">Properly fill the attributes of the <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code> file  (AV2215) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Ensure that the attributes for the company name, description, copyright statement, version, etc. are filled. One way to ensure that version and other fields that are common to all assemblies have the same values, is to move the corresponding attributes out of the <code>AssemblyInfo.cs</code> into a <code>SolutionInfo.cs</code> file that is shared by all projects within a solution. </p>
<h3 id="avoid-linq-for-simple-expressions-av2220-images-3-png-">Avoid LINQ for simple expressions  (AV2220) <img src="images/3.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Rather than:</p>
<pre><code>var query = from item in items where item.Length &gt; 0;
</code></pre><p>prefer the use of extension methods from the <code>System.Linq</code> namespace:</p>
<pre><code>var query = items.Where(i =&gt; i.Length &gt; 0);
</code></pre><p>Since LINQ queries should be written out over multiple lines for readability, the second example is a bit more readable.</p>
<h3 id="use-lambda-expressions-instead-of-delegates-av2221-images-png-">Use Lambda expressions instead of delegates  (AV2221) <img src="images/?.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Lambda expressions provide a much more elegant alternative for anonymous delegates. So instead of:</p>
<pre><code>Customer c = Array.Find(customers, delegate(Customer c)
{
    return c.Name == &quot;Tom&quot;;
});
</code></pre><p>use a Lambda expression:</p>
<pre><code>Customer c = Array.Find(customers, c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Tom&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Or even better:</p>
<pre><code>var customer = customers.Where(c =&gt; c.Name == &quot;Tom&quot;);
</code></pre><h3 id="only-use-the-dynamic-keyword-when-talking-to-a-dynamic-object-av2230-images-1-png-">Only use the <code>dynamic</code> keyword when talking to a dynamic object  (AV2230) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>The <code>dynamic</code> keyword has been introduced for working with dynamic languages. Using it introduces a serious performance bottleneck because the compiler has to generate some complex Reflection code.</p>
<p>Use it only for calling methods or members of a dynamically created instance calss (using the <code>Activator</code>) as an alternative to <code>Type.GetProperty()</code> and <code>Type.GetMethod()</code>, or for working with COM Interop types.</p>
<h3 id="favor-async-await-over-the-task-av2235-images-1-png-">Favor <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> over the Task (AV2235) <img src="images/1.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Using the new C# 5.0 keywords results in code that can still be read sequentially and also improves maintainability a lot, even if you need to chain multiple asynchronous operations. For example, rather than defining your method like this:</p>
<pre><code>public Task GetDataAsync()
{
  return MyWebService.FetchDataAsync()
    .ContinueWith(t =&gt; new Data(t.Result));
}
</code></pre><p>define it like this:</p>
<pre><code>public async Task GetDataAsync()
{
  var result = await MyWebService.FetchDataAsync();
  return new Data (result);
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even if you need to target .NET Framework 4.0 you can use the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords. Simply install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29576">Async Targeting Pack</a>.</p>

<li><p>Add a whitespace around operators, like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>==</code>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always follow the keywords <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>do</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code> and <code>foreach</code> with opening and closing parentheses, even though the language does not require it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Always put opening and closing parentheses on a new line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t indent object Initializers and initialize each property on a new line, so use a format like this: </p>
<pre><code>  var dto = new ConsumerDto()
  {  
      Id = 123,  
      Name = &quot;Microsoft&quot;,  
      PartnerShip = PartnerShip.Gold
  }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t indent lambda statements and use a format like this:</p>
<pre><code>  methodThatTakesAnAction.Do(x =&gt;
  { 
      // do something like this 
  }
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Put the entire LINQ statement on one line, or start each keyword at the same indentation, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  var query = from product in products where product.Price &gt; 10 select product;

or

  var query =  from product in products  
               where product.Price &gt; 10  select product;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Start the LINQ statement with all the <code>from</code> expressions and don&#39;t interweave them with restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add braces around every comparison condition, but don&#39;t add braces around a singular condition. For example <code>if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(str) &amp;&amp; (str != &quot;new&quot;))</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an empty line between multi-line statements, between members, after the closing parentheses, between unrelated code blocks, around the <code>#region</code> keyword, and between the <code>using</code> statements of different root namespaces.</p>
</li>

<p>Maintaining a common order allows other team members to find their way in your code more easily. In general, a source file should be readable from top to bottom, as if reading a book, to prevent readers from having to browse up and down through the code file.</p>

<li>Public constants</li>
<li>Public read-only static fields</li>

<p>Regions can be helpful, but can also hide the main purpose of a class. Therefore, use <code>#regions</code> only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private fields and constants (preferably in a <code>Private Definitions</code> region).</li>
<li>Nested classes</li>
<li>Interface implementations (only if the interface is not the main purpose of that class)<h1 id="important-resources">Important Resources</h1>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670">Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction</a> (Steve McConnel)<br>One of the best books I&#39;ve ever read. It deals with all aspects of software development, and even though the book was originally written in 2004 you&#39;ll be surprised when you see how accurate it still is. I wrote a <a href="http://www.continuousimprover.com/2009/07/book-review-code-complete-2nd-edition.html">review</a> in 2009 if you want to get a sense of its contents.</p>
